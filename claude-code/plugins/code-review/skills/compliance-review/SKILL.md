# Compliance Code Review Skill

Verify code adherence to AI Agent Instructions (CLAUDE.md, copilot-instructions, and similar files) and project-specific rules through targeted compliance-focused code review.

## Applicable Contexts

- CLAUDE.md compliance checking
- Coding standards verification
- AI agent instructions review
- Project guidelines validation
- Convention adherence checking
- Architecture pattern compliance
- Naming convention verification

## Process Overview

1. **Determine scope** - Identify code requiring compliance review
2. **Gather context** - Detect project type and locate all AI instruction files
3. **Launch compliance agent** - Execute thorough mode, then gaps mode
4. **Validate findings** - Confirm issues against exact rule text
5. **Report results** - Generate output with exact rule citations

For detailed procedures on steps 1, 2 (project type detection), 4, and 5, see `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/skill-common-workflow.md`.

## Compliance-Specific Configuration

### Agent Parameters

- **Agent:** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/compliance-agent.md`
- **Model:** Sonnet (for efficient compliance checking)
- **Modes:** thorough (first pass), gaps (second pass)

### Instruction File Locations (Part of Step 2)

See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/skill-common-workflow.md` Step 2 for the canonical search order.

## Rule Classification

For rule classification (MUST/SHOULD/MAY keywords and severity mapping), see `references/compliance-patterns.md`.

---

## Compliance Categories Checked

**Architecture Violations (Major):**
- Layer violations (UI importing from data layer)
- Business logic in wrong location (controller, view)
- Direct database access bypassing repositories
- Circular dependencies

**Naming Convention Violations (Minor to Major):**
- File naming patterns (kebab-case, PascalCase)
- Class/function/variable naming
- Constant naming (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE)
- Interface prefixing (I prefix in C#)

**Documentation Requirements (Minor):**
- Missing JSDoc/XMLDoc on public APIs
- Undocumented complex functions
- README updates for new features

**Security Requirements (Major):**
- Missing authentication on endpoints
- Input validation gaps
- Logging requirements for sensitive operations

## Auto-Validated Patterns

These high-confidence patterns skip validation:

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `missing_authorize_attribute` | Controller action without `[Authorize]` when CLAUDE.md requires auth |
| `wrong_case_filename` | File using wrong case pattern (e.g., PascalCase in Node.js project) |
| `explicit_must_violation` | Code contradicts explicit "MUST" or "MUST NOT" rule with exact match |
| `missing_required_jsdoc` | Public API without JSDoc when CLAUDE.md requires documentation |

---

## Compliance-Specific False Positives

Do NOT flag:
- Explicit override comments (`// claude-ignore: rule-name`)
- Scope mismatch (rule doesn't apply to this file type)
- Ambiguous rule (benefit of doubt to code)
- Intentional deviation with documented reason
- Framework exemption (framework provides required behavior)

### Ignore Comment Patterns

Respect these silencing patterns:
```javascript
// claude-ignore: no-console
// eslint-disable-next-line rule-name
// @ts-ignore: explanation
```

---

## Rule Citation Guidelines

Always include exact rule citation:

- **Rule text**: Exact quoted text from instruction file
- **Source**: File path and line number
- **Keyword**: The strength keyword (MUST, SHOULD, MAY)

Example: "The endpoint violates 'All API endpoints MUST have authentication' from CLAUDE.md:31"

---

## Compliance Score

Include in output:

```markdown
### Compliance Score

- Rules checked: 28
- Rules passed: 24
- Rules violated: 4
- Compliance rate: 86%
```

---

## Example Output

See `examples/example-output.md` for a sample showing:
- Missing authentication violation with diff fix
- Business logic in controller with prompt fix
- Missing JSDoc violation with diff fix
