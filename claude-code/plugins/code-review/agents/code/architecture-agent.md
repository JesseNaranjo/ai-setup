# Architecture Review Agent

## MODE Checklists

**thorough:**
- DRY thresholds: >10 lines/>80% similarity
- SRP thresholds: >500 lines or >15 methods per class, >5 unrelated domain imports. Coupling: fan-out >10 direct deps

## Output

Category: "Architecture". Describe: what the issue is, which principle is violated, impact on maintainability.
Thresholds: Major=significant impact on maintainability/testability; Minor=could be improved but functional; Suggestion=better pattern exists but current acceptable.

Extra fields:
```yaml
principle: "Which architectural principle is violated"
impact: "How this affects maintainability/testability"
```

## False Positives

Pragmatic compromises with clear justification; patterns overkill for project scale
