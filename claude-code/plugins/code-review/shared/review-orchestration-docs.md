# Documentation Review Orchestration

This document defines agent invocation patterns and execution sequences for documentation review pipelines.

## Agent Invocation

Plugin agents are registered as subagent types with the pattern `code-review:<agent-name>`.

Use the Task tool to launch each agent. Always pass the `model` parameter explicitly (see Documentation Review Model Selection table below).

```
Task(
  subagent_type: "code-review:<agent-name>",
  model: "<model>",  // See Documentation Review Model Selection table
  description: "[Agent name] review for [scope]",
  prompt: "<prompt fields below>"
)
```

### Prompt Schema

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `MODE` | string | Yes | `thorough`, `gaps`, or `quick` |
| `project_type` | string | Yes | `nodejs`, `dotnet`, or both |
| `files_to_review` | list | Yes | See File Entry Schema below |
| `ai_instructions` | list | Optional | Summary of AI instruction files for context |
| `previous_findings` | list | Gaps only | Prior findings for deduplication. Each entry: `title`, `file`, `line`, `range` (string or null), `category`, `severity` |
| `skill_instructions` | object | Optional | From `--skills` argument. Fields: `focus_areas` (list), `checklist` (list of {category, severity, items}), `auto_validate` (list), `false_positive_rules` (list), `methodology` ({approach, steps, questions}) |
| `additional_instructions` | string | Optional | Combined content from settings file body + `--prompt` argument |

### File Entry Schema

**Critical files** (has_changes: true, tier: "critical"):

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `path` | string | Relative file path |
| `has_changes` | boolean | `true` |
| `tier` | string | `"critical"` |
| `diff` | string | Unified diff content |
| `full_content` | string | Complete file content |

**Peripheral files** (staged reviews — unchanged context files):

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `path` | string | Relative file path |
| `has_changes` | boolean | `false` |
| `tier` | string | `"peripheral"` |
| `preview` | string | First ~50 lines |
| `line_count` | integer | Total lines in file |
| `full_content_available` | boolean | `true` (agent can use Read tool) |

End the prompt with: `Return findings as YAML per agent examples in your agent file.`

## Deep Docs Review Sequence (13 agent invocations)

1. **Steps 1-3: Input, Context, Content**
   - Discover and validate documentation files
   - Gather doc content and related code references
   - OUTPUT: Documentation files, related code snippets, AI instruction files

2. **Phase 1: Thorough Review** (6 agents in parallel)
   - Launch: accuracy, clarity, completeness, consistency, examples, structure
   - Models: accuracy, completeness, examples (Opus); clarity, consistency, structure (Sonnet)
   - MODE: `thorough` for all agents
   - **CRITICAL: WAIT** - DO NOT proceed to Phase 2 until ALL 6 agents complete
   - OUTPUT: Phase 1 findings (grouped by category)

3. **Phase 2: Gaps Review** (3 Sonnet agents in parallel)
   - Launch: accuracy, completeness, consistency
   - MODE: `gaps`
   - Model: Sonnet (cost-optimized for constrained task)
   - INPUT: Phase 1 findings passed as `previous_findings`
   - **CRITICAL: WAIT** - DO NOT proceed to Synthesis until ALL 3 agents complete
   - OUTPUT: Phase 2 findings (subtle issues, edge cases)

4. **Synthesis** (4 agents in parallel)
   - **CRITICAL: DO NOT START until Phase 1 AND Phase 2 are FULLY COMPLETE**
   - Launch: 4 instances of synthesis-docs-agent with category pairs
   - INPUT: ALL findings from Phase 1 AND Phase 2
   - Pairs and questions:
     - Accuracy+Examples: "Do code examples match the documented behavior they claim to demonstrate?"
     - Clarity+Structure: "Does poor structure contribute to clarity issues, or vice versa?"
     - Completeness+Consistency: "Are missing sections causing terminology inconsistencies elsewhere?"
     - Consistency+Structure: "Do formatting inconsistencies reflect structural organization problems?"
   - WAIT: All 4 must complete
   - OUTPUT: `cross_cutting_insights` list

5. **Validation, Aggregation, Output**
   - Validate all issues, filter invalid, deduplicate, generate report

## Quick Docs Review Sequence (7 agent invocations)

1. **Steps 1-3: Input, Context, Content** (same as deep)

2. **Review** (4 agents in parallel)
   - Launch: accuracy, clarity, examples, structure
   - MODE: `quick` for all agents
   - OUTPUT: Quick review findings

3. **Synthesis** (3 agents in parallel)
   - Pairs and questions:
     - Accuracy+Examples: "Do code examples match the documented behavior they claim to demonstrate?"
     - Clarity+Structure: "Does poor structure contribute to clarity issues, or vice versa?"
     - Examples+Structure: "Are example placements and references structurally sound?"
   - OUTPUT: `cross_cutting_insights` list

4. **Validation, Aggregation, Output** (same as deep)

## Documentation Review Model Selection (Authoritative Source)

| Agent | Model (thorough) | Model (gaps) | Model (quick) |
|-------|------------------|--------------|---------------|
| accuracy-agent | opus | sonnet | opus |
| clarity-agent | sonnet | N/A | sonnet |
| completeness-agent | opus | sonnet | N/A |
| consistency-agent | sonnet | sonnet | N/A |
| examples-agent | opus | N/A | opus |
| structure-agent | sonnet | N/A | sonnet |
| synthesis-docs-agent | sonnet | N/A | sonnet |

## Synthesis Invocation

The synthesis agents are designed to be invoked **multiple times in parallel** with different category pairs.

See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/docs/synthesis-docs-agent.md` for the full agent definition and analysis logic.

### Synthesis Prompt Schema

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `synthesis_input.category_a.name` | string | Yes | First category name |
| `synthesis_input.category_a.findings` | list | Yes | All findings from category_a (Phase 1 + Phase 2) |
| `synthesis_input.category_b.name` | string | Yes | Second category name |
| `synthesis_input.category_b.findings` | list | Yes | All findings from category_b (Phase 1 + Phase 2) |
| `synthesis_input.cross_cutting_question` | string | Yes | The cross-cutting analysis question |
| `synthesis_input.files_content` | list | Yes | File diffs and full content for context |

### Parallel Synthesis Pattern

Commands launch multiple instances of the synthesis agent simultaneously, each with different category pairs. Each instance operates independently and returns its own `cross_cutting_insights` list. The orchestrating command merges all results.

**Authoritative source for category pairs:** See Deep Docs Review Sequence (4 pairs) and Quick Docs Review Sequence (3 pairs) above.

# Documentation Review Validation Rules

This section defines the validation process and domain-specific patterns for documentation review commands.

## Batch Validation Process

See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/validation-aggregation.md` for the common validation process (grouping, cross-cutting insight validation, batch validator prompt, false positives, verdicts).

### Validator Model Assignment

| Issue Category | Validator Model |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Accuracy | Opus |
| Clarity | Sonnet |
| Completeness | Opus |
| Consistency | Sonnet |
| Examples | Opus |
| Structure | Sonnet |

**Cross-cutting insights** (from synthesis-docs-agent) always use **Opus** for validation.

**Note for Quick Reviews:** Despite the quick review philosophy of using Sonnet where possible, cross-cutting insights still use Opus for validation because they represent novel connections between categories that require more nuanced judgment to validate. The time savings of Sonnet validation does not justify the risk of missing subtle cross-category interactions.

### Auto-Validation (Skip Validation)

Some high-confidence patterns skip validation entirely and are marked `auto_validated: true`:

**Domain-specific patterns:** See Auto-Validation Patterns (Documentation) section below.

## Aggregation Rules

See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/validation-aggregation.md` for aggregation rules (remove invalid, apply downgrades, deduplicate, consensus detection).

## Auto-Validation Patterns (Documentation)

Some high-confidence patterns skip validation entirely and are marked `auto_validated: true`:

**Accuracy patterns (always valid):**

| Pattern Name | Regex | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `api_signature_mismatch` | N/A (detected via code comparison) | Documented function signature differs from implementation |
| `missing_parameter_doc` | N/A (detected via param comparison) | Parameter exists in code but not documented |
| `outdated_version_reference` | N/A (detected via version comparison) | Documentation references older version than package.json/csproj |

**Clarity patterns (always valid):**

| Pattern Name | Regex | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `undefined_acronym` | `\b[A-Z]{2,}\b(?!.*\([^)]+\))` | Acronym used without expansion (first occurrence) |
| `passive_voice_instruction` | N/A (detected via NLP analysis) | Instructions written in passive voice |

**Completeness patterns (always valid):**

| Pattern Name | Regex | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `missing_api_doc` | N/A (detected via export comparison) | Exported function/class has no documentation |
| `empty_section` | `^#+\s+.+\n\s*\n(?=^#+)` | Section header with no content before next header |
| `missing_error_handling_doc` | N/A (detected via throw analysis) | Function throws but no error documentation |

**Consistency patterns (always valid):**

| Pattern Name | Regex | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `inconsistent_terminology` | N/A (detected via term frequency analysis) | Same concept named differently across docs |
| `inconsistent_heading_style` | N/A (detected via heading pattern analysis) | Mixed title case and sentence case headings |

**Examples patterns (always valid):**

| Pattern Name | Regex | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `example_syntax_error` | N/A (detected via parser) | Code example has syntax error |
| `example_undefined_import` | N/A (detected via import analysis) | Example uses undefined import |

**Structure patterns (always valid):**

| Pattern Name | Regex | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `broken_internal_link` | `\[([^\]]+)\]\((?!https?://)([^)]+)\)` | Internal markdown link (check target exists) |
| `missing_ai_instruction_header` | N/A (detected via header check) | CLAUDE.md missing required header comment |
| `ai_instruction_wrong_location` | N/A (detected via path check) | AI instruction file in wrong directory |

## Category-Specific False Positive Rules (Documentation)

Each category has specific exclusions in addition to the general false positive rules in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/agent-common-instructions.md`.

### Accuracy

- Intentionally simplified examples (marked as "simplified" or "basic example")
- Pseudocode clearly marked as illustrative
- Version-specific documentation with version clearly noted
- Documentation for planned/upcoming features marked as such

### Clarity

- Jargon appropriate for stated expert audience
- Acronyms defined earlier in the same document
- Industry-standard terms in domain-specific docs (e.g., "REST" in API docs)
- Intentionally terse reference documentation (vs tutorials)
- Code comments within code blocks (different standards apply)

### Completeness

- Internal/private APIs not intended for external use
- Features clearly marked as experimental/unstable
- Configuration options with sensible defaults that rarely need changing
- Platform-specific docs when project only targets one platform
- Sections that would duplicate content available elsewhere (with link)

### Consistency

- Intentional variations for emphasis or clarity
- Code/API names that must match implementation (even if inconsistent with prose style)
- Quoted text that preserves original formatting
- Version-specific sections that intentionally differ
- External content (quotes, references) with different style

### Examples

- Pseudocode clearly marked as illustrative (not runnable)
- Intentionally simplified examples with explicit notes about what's omitted
- Partial examples with "..." indicating omitted code
- Examples for older versions in clearly versioned documentation
- Examples showing error cases (intentionally incorrect code to demonstrate what not to do)
- Shell examples with placeholder values like `<your-token>`

### Structure

- Intentionally orphaned archive/historical documents
- External links to known-stable resources (official docs, RFCs)
- Heading hierarchy violations in code-generated documentation
- Alternative navigation paths that are intentional (multiple entry points)
- AI instruction files in projects that don't use AI assistants (if explicitly stated)
