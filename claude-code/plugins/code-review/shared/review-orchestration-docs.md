# Documentation Review Orchestration

This document defines agent invocation patterns and execution sequences for documentation review pipelines.

## Agent Invocation

Plugin agents are registered as subagent types with the pattern `code-review:<agent-name>`. Always pass the `model` parameter explicitly (see Documentation Review Model Selection table below).

### Prompt Schema

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `MODE` | string | Yes | `thorough`, `gaps`, or `quick` |
| `project_type` | string | Yes | `nodejs`, `dotnet`, or both |
| `files_to_review` | list | Yes | See File Entry Schema below |
| `ai_instructions` | list | Optional | Summary of AI instruction files for context |
| `previous_findings` | list | Gaps only | Prior findings for deduplication. Each entry: `title`, `file`, `line`, `range` (string or null), `category`, `severity` |
| `skill_instructions` | object | Optional | From `--skills` argument. Fields: `focus_areas` (list), `checklist` (list of {category, severity, items}), `auto_validate` (list), `false_positive_rules` (list), `methodology` ({approach, steps, questions}) |
| `additional_instructions` | string | Optional | Combined content from settings file body + `--prompt` argument + orchestrator-injected rules (gaps behavior, pre-existing detection) |

### File Entry Schema

**Critical files** (has_changes: true, tier: "critical"):

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `path` | string | Relative file path |
| `has_changes` | boolean | `true` |
| `tier` | string | `"critical"` |
| `diff` | string | Unified diff content |
| `full_content` | string | Complete file content |

**Peripheral files** (staged reviews — unchanged context files):

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `path` | string | Relative file path |
| `has_changes` | boolean | `false` |
| `tier` | string | `"peripheral"` |
| `preview` | string | First ~50 lines |
| `line_count` | integer | Total lines in file |
| `full_content_available` | boolean | `true` (agent can use Read tool) |

End the prompt with: `Return findings as YAML per agent examples in your agent file.`

### Content Distribution Optimization

#### Agent Common Content Distribution

The orchestrator reads shared content files ONCE and distributes relevant portions to each agent via `additional_instructions`, eliminating per-agent file reads.

**Source files (read by orchestrator, not by agents):**
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/agent-common-instructions.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/references/validation-rules-docs.md` "Category-Specific False Positive Rules"

**Distribution per agent** (append to `additional_instructions`):
1. **Output schema** from agent-common-instructions.md
2. **MODE definition** matching the current mode
3. **General false positive rules** from agent-common-instructions.md
4. **Category-specific false positive rules** — extract ONLY the agent's category section from validation-rules-docs.md

Synthesis agents are excluded from this distribution.

## Gaps Mode Behavior

When MODE=gaps, agents receive `previous_findings` from thorough mode to avoid duplicates.

### Duplicate Detection (Common to All Gaps Agents)

- Skip issues in same file within +/-5 lines of prior findings
- Skip same issue type on same function/method
- For range findings (lines A-B): skip zone = [A-5, B+5]

See Prompt Schema table above (`previous_findings` field) for the schema.

### Constraints (Common to All Gaps Agents)

- Only report Major or Critical severity (skip Minor/Suggestion)
- Maximum 5 new findings per agent
- Model: Always Sonnet (cost optimization)

### Gaps-Supporting Agents

**Documentation review:** accuracy, completeness, consistency.

See each agent file for category-specific focus areas (what subtle issues thorough mode misses).

## Deep Docs Review Sequence (13 agent invocations)

1. **Steps 1-3: Input, Context, Content**
   - Discover and validate documentation files
   - Gather doc content and related code references
   - OUTPUT: Documentation files, related code snippets, AI instruction files

2. **Phase 1: Thorough Review** (6 agents in parallel)
   - Launch: accuracy, clarity, completeness, consistency, examples, structure
   - Models: accuracy, completeness, examples (Opus); clarity, consistency, structure (Sonnet)
   - MODE: `thorough` for all agents
   - **CRITICAL: WAIT** - DO NOT proceed to Phase 2 until ALL 6 agents complete
   - OUTPUT: Phase 1 findings (grouped by category)

3. **Phase 2: Gaps Review** (3 Sonnet agents in parallel)
   - Launch: accuracy, completeness, consistency
   - MODE: `gaps`
   - Model: Sonnet (cost-optimized for constrained task)
   - INPUT: Phase 1 findings passed as `previous_findings`
   - **CRITICAL: WAIT** - DO NOT proceed to Synthesis until ALL 3 agents complete
   - OUTPUT: Phase 2 findings (subtle issues, edge cases)

4. **Synthesis** (4 agents in parallel)
   - **CRITICAL: DO NOT START until Phase 1 AND Phase 2 are FULLY COMPLETE**
   - Launch: 4 instances of synthesis-docs-agent with category pairs
   - INPUT: ALL findings from Phase 1 AND Phase 2
   - Pairs and questions:
     - Accuracy+Examples: "Do code examples match the documented behavior they claim to demonstrate?"
     - Clarity+Structure: "Does poor structure contribute to clarity issues, or vice versa?"
     - Completeness+Consistency: "Are missing sections causing terminology inconsistencies elsewhere?"
     - Consistency+Structure: "Do formatting inconsistencies reflect structural organization problems?"
   - WAIT: All 4 must complete
   - OUTPUT: `cross_cutting_insights` list

5. **Validation, Aggregation, Output**
   - Validate all issues, filter invalid, deduplicate, generate report

## Quick Docs Review Sequence (7 agent invocations)

1. **Steps 1-3: Input, Context, Content** (same as deep)

2. **Review** (4 agents in parallel)
   - Launch: accuracy, clarity, examples, structure
   - MODE: `quick` for all agents
   - OUTPUT: Quick review findings

3. **Synthesis** (3 agents in parallel)
   - Pairs and questions:
     - Accuracy+Examples: "Do code examples match the documented behavior they claim to demonstrate?"
     - Clarity+Structure: "Does poor structure contribute to clarity issues, or vice versa?"
     - Examples+Structure: "Are example placements and references structurally sound?"
   - OUTPUT: `cross_cutting_insights` list

4. **Validation, Aggregation, Output** (same as deep)

## Documentation Review Model Selection (Authoritative Source)

| Agent | Model (thorough) | Model (gaps) | Model (quick) |
|-------|------------------|--------------|---------------|
| accuracy-agent | opus | sonnet | opus |
| clarity-agent | sonnet | N/A | sonnet |
| completeness-agent | opus | sonnet | N/A |
| consistency-agent | sonnet | sonnet | N/A |
| examples-agent | opus | N/A | opus |
| structure-agent | sonnet | N/A | sonnet |
| synthesis-docs-agent | sonnet | N/A | sonnet |

## Synthesis Invocation

The synthesis agents are designed to be invoked **multiple times in parallel** with different category pairs.

See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/docs/synthesis-docs-agent.md` for the full agent definition and analysis logic.

### Synthesis Prompt Schema

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `synthesis_input.category_a.name` | string | Yes | First category name |
| `synthesis_input.category_a.findings` | list | Yes | All findings from category_a (Phase 1 + Phase 2) |
| `synthesis_input.category_b.name` | string | Yes | Second category name |
| `synthesis_input.category_b.findings` | list | Yes | All findings from category_b (Phase 1 + Phase 2) |
| `synthesis_input.cross_cutting_question` | string | Yes | The cross-cutting analysis question |
| `synthesis_input.files_content` | list | Yes | File diffs and full content for context |

### Parallel Synthesis Pattern

Launch all category pairs simultaneously; merge results. Pairs defined in Deep Docs Review Sequence (4) and Quick Docs Review Sequence (3) above.
