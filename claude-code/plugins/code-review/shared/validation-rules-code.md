# Code Review Validation Rules

This document defines the validation process and domain-specific patterns for code review commands.

## Batch Validation Process

To optimize cost and latency, issues are validated in batches grouped by file rather than individually.

### Grouping Strategy

1. **Group by file**: All issues for the same file are validated in a single agent call
2. **Group by validator model**: Issues requiring same model (Opus vs Sonnet) are grouped together
3. **Benefit**: Reduces agent invocations from N issues to M files (typically 60-80% reduction)

### Validator Model Assignment

| Issue Category | Validator Model |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Accuracy | Opus |
| API Contracts | Sonnet |
| Architecture | Opus |
| Bugs | Opus |
| Clarity | Sonnet |
| Completeness | Opus |
| Compliance | Sonnet |
| Consistency | Sonnet |
| Error Handling | Sonnet |
| Examples | Opus |
| Performance | Opus |
| Security | Opus |
| Structure | Sonnet |
| Technical Debt | Sonnet |
| Test Coverage | Sonnet |

**Cross-cutting insights** (from synthesis-code-agent or synthesis-docs-agent) always use **Opus** for validation.

**Note for Quick Reviews:** Despite the quick review philosophy of using Sonnet where possible, cross-cutting insights still use Opus for validation because they represent novel connections between categories that require more nuanced judgment to validate. The time savings of Sonnet validation does not justify the risk of missing subtle cross-category interactions.

### Quick Review Validation Scope

Quick reviews validate **Critical and Major severity issues only**. Minor issues and Suggestions skip the validation phase entirely to optimize for speed. This means:

- Critical/Major issues: Full validation with appropriate model
- Minor issues: Auto-accepted without validation
- Suggestions: Auto-accepted without validation

This differs from deep reviews, which validate all severity levels.

### Cross-Cutting Insight Validation

Synthesis agents produce `cross_cutting_insights` that require special validation:

1. **Integration Point**: Cross-cutting insights are added to the issue pool AFTER synthesis completes, BEFORE validation begins
2. **Category Assignment**: Each insight specifies a `category` field - use this for validator model assignment
3. **Validator Model**: Cross-cutting insights always use **Opus** for validation
4. **Related Findings Check**: Validator must verify that BOTH `related_findings` references exist in the original findings

**Cross-Cutting Validation Checks:**
1. Verify both related findings are real issues (not false positives)
2. Verify the insight describes a genuine interaction between the two
3. Verify the insight is NOT a duplicate of either original finding
4. Verify the insight adds value beyond what each category found independently

**Cross-Cutting Deduplication**: If a cross-cutting insight duplicates an issue from the original category findings:
- Mark as INVALID with reason: "Duplicates existing finding from [category]"
- The original finding takes precedence

### Batch Validator Prompt

**Skip validation for:** Issues in test files (unless explicitly testing production code paths), style suggestions without functional impact, and documentation suggestions.

For each file with issues, launch ONE validator. Prompt schema:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `file_path` | string | File being validated |
| `issues_to_validate[].id` | integer | Sequential issue ID |
| `issues_to_validate[].title` | string | Issue title |
| `issues_to_validate[].line` | integer | Line number |
| `issues_to_validate[].category` | string | Issue category |
| `issues_to_validate[].severity` | string | Issue severity |
| `issues_to_validate[].description` | string | Issue description |

**Required return format:**

```yaml
validations:
  - id: 1
    verdict: VALID|INVALID|DOWNGRADE
    new_severity: # only if DOWNGRADE
    reason: "brief explanation"
```

### Auto-Validation (Skip Validation)

Some high-confidence patterns skip validation entirely and are marked `auto_validated: true`:

**Domain-specific patterns:** See Auto-Validation Patterns (Code) section below.

**Notes on pattern matching:**
- Patterns are case-insensitive for SQL keywords
- Patterns require at least one character (`[^'"]+`) to avoid matching empty string placeholders like `password = ""`
- Patterns check for common variable names indicating user input: `req`, `request`, `params`, `query`, `body`, `input`, `user`
- Empty catch pattern allows a single comment line to avoid flagging intentional empty catches with explanation

### Auto-Validation Output

```yaml
issues:
  - title: "Hardcoded database password"
    auto_validated: true
    confidence_pattern: "hardcoded_credential"
    ...
```

### Common False Positives to Check

Validators should check for these common false positive patterns:

1. **Pre-existing issues**: The issue existed before the changes being reviewed
2. **Context makes it correct**: The code appears wrong but has valid context
3. **Handled elsewhere**: The issue is addressed in another part of the codebase
4. **Explicit ignore comments**: The issue is intentionally silenced (lint-ignore, etc.)
5. **Theoretical only**: The issue requires unrealistic conditions to manifest
6. **Test/dev code**: The issue is in test or development-only code paths
7. **Internal code**: The issue is in internal code with no external exposure

### Validation Output

Each validator returns:
- **VALID**: Issue is confirmed, keep original severity
- **INVALID**: Issue is a false positive, remove from results
- **DOWNGRADE**: Issue is real but severity should be lower

## Aggregation Rules

After validation, perform these aggregation steps:

### 1. Remove Invalid Issues

Filter out all issues marked INVALID by their validator.

### 2. Apply Severity Downgrades

For issues marked DOWNGRADE:
- Update the severity to the new level specified by the validator
- Keep the original description and details

### 3. Deduplicate Issues

When multiple agents flag the same issue:
- Merge issues for the same file and overlapping line ranges
- Keep the most detailed description
- Use the highest severity among the merged issues
- Add a consensus badge indicating multiple agents flagged it

### 4. Consensus Detection Algorithm

1. **Group by file** and detect overlapping issues (same file, intersecting line ranges: NOT (L2 < M1 OR M2 < L1))
2. **Build clusters** transitively (if A overlaps B and B overlaps C, cluster = {A, B, C})
3. **Merge each cluster**: use highest severity, longest description, combined categories, and add badge (`[2 agents]` or `[3+ agents]`) prepended to title

## Category-Specific False Positive Rules (Code)

Each category has specific exclusions in addition to the general false positive rules in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/agent-common-instructions.md`.

### API Contracts

- Internal/private API changes
- Changes to APIs with no external consumers
- Additive changes that don't break existing consumers
- Changes that follow established deprecation process
- Beta/experimental APIs clearly marked as unstable

### Architecture

- Pragmatic compromises with clear justification
- Patterns that are overkill for the scale of the project
- Architecture decisions already documented and justified
- Temporary code with clear TODOs

### Bug Detection

- Code that appears buggy but is correct in context
- Defensive code that handles edge cases (unless it has a bug)
- Code with explicit comments explaining why it's correct

### Compliance

- Code that appears to violate a rule but has an explicit override comment
- Ambiguous rules where the code could reasonably be compliant
- Rules that don't apply to this file type or context
- Style preferences not explicitly stated as rules

### Error Handling

- Code where errors are intentionally ignored with explicit comments
- Errors that are handled at a higher level
- Internal code with documented error handling strategy
- Logging-only catch blocks where that's the intended behavior

### Performance

- Micro-optimizations that won't have measurable impact
- Performance issues in code that runs rarely
- Code that prioritizes readability over minor performance gains

### Security

- Internal-only code with no untrusted input exposure
- Code with explicit security comments explaining the design
- Vulnerabilities already mitigated elsewhere in the code

### Technical Debt

- Dependencies intentionally pinned for compatibility (documented reason)
- Legacy patterns in legacy modules explicitly marked as deprecated
- Dead code that's actually conditionally compiled (build flags)
- TODO comments that reference issue tracking (TODO(#123))
- Workarounds with documented upstream bugs and tracking
- Class components in projects supporting older React versions intentionally

### Test Coverage

- Private/internal implementation details
- Code that's impractical to unit test (better suited for integration tests)
- Code already covered by higher-level tests
- Test files themselves (don't require tests of tests)
- Generated code or boilerplate
- Configuration files or constants
- Dead code that should be removed rather than tested
